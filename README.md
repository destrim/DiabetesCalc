# PwJSProject
Project on Programming in Script Languages laboratories.

## Description
Project goal is to create script in _Python_ that calculates the probability of having diabetes using _Machine Learning_.
Script is based on _KNN_ (_k-nearest neighbors_) algorithm.
Diabetes dataset used in the project to train and test the algorithm can be found here: https://datahub.io/machine-learning/diabetes.
PDF file included in the repository covers basisc of the _KNN_ algorithm and research about how changing _k_ value and feature scaling affects the accuracy of the algorithm.

## Setup
Make sure you have installed requirements.txt
